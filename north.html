   <br>
   <p class="m-2">North by Northwest is part espionage,  part romance and part thriller, but moulded in full Hitchcockian fashion. Alfred Hitchcock has managed to combine all these elements into a complete film filled with deceit and red herring. Here’s the short synopsis, The film about is about an advertising agent Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) Who got caught between the crossfire of the CIA and Vandmamm, a spy and wrongly accused of killing a UN Diplomatic. And How all things panned out, it’s told in a pure Hitchcock fashion.</p>
   <h3 class="m-1">Bomb under the table theory:</h3>
   <p class="m-2">Hitchcock proposed an idea called ”Bomb under the table". It’s the simple distinction between suspense and surprise, which goes on like this, for example, take a scenario where you in a restaurant and unbeknownst to you there’s a bomb under the table that you're sitting which explodes—hold on to this scenario we’ll be comeback to this moment later. Consider the same scenario where you’re sitting at the table, but now you know there’s a bomb ready to go off at any minute – what will you do to stop it?? Is there any way you can escape??. Did you get any clue where this whole passage leading up to if you get its great if not it's fine because MB is going to take care of everything. Those scenarios are combinedly called “Bomb under the Table". According to Hitchcock if the bomb goes off, it'll create surprise and shock which will only last for a few moments. But what if you know there's a bomb under the desk and there's a timer, this creates suspense which makes viewers latch on to their seat belts. Now it’s not the fact the bomb explodes, but how the bomb it's going off. The moments of impending doom and tension that this thing may or may not go off from the table is what makes Alfred Hitchcock -The master of suspense. Most of the modern films totally discard the value of building suspense by opting the easy out. Now I'm not saying that the "shock" factor is inherently a bad thing, it's just that there are plethora of ways to create good cinema instead of cheap jumpscares and mindless shooting(that's coming from the guy who loves MI and John Wick franchises). It's maybe the time for filmmakers to take the audience seriously and respect their IQs.  
       Now we’ll see how Hitchcock achieves those things in the movie North by Northwest.</p>

    <p class="m-2">  The scene opens up with an extreme Wide shot of a bus reaching its designated bus stop in a vast empty road and around which what looks like an arid field with the camera looking down like us looking into the big screen with big blue eyes. Roger get down from the bus and looks around the area for Mr Kaplon who supposed to show up on this place. As he looks around the field, we see a cropduster flying over the field and what it seems to be a harmless entity for our protagonist since it's shown in an extreme WS. As the scene progresses, Roger waits for the Real Kaplon to show up with each car passes by creating tension and doubt on both the viewer and Roger. Finally, he sees a car approaching him from the other side of the road and Mr Roger now feels a sigh of relief that he can undo the situation that he was wrongly accused of.</p>

    <p class="m-2">  The mini-sequence starts with two men occupying the two corners of the frame with the road acting as a divider between the two. With a bit of uncertainty, he approaches the other man with shot cut from WS to Mid-Shot of Roger and ends with a pov shot of him reaching the other side of the road. And he asks, Is he waiting for someone and he replies by saying yes. We can see a momentary relief on Roger's face, but all those things vanish when the stranger hopped onto the bus. Now he’s left with a bit of a shock and confusion, but at the same time he sees a cropduster flying closer to him and growing in stature as it nears him with gun blazing and he tries to evade from those attacks. And that’s how Hitchcock plants the bomb at the start of the scene which is almost unnoticeable since we don’t consider it to a have any effect on the scenario which to be played out and it explodes when we thought the situation cannot get worse for Mr Roger. As the chase continues to the nearby field, Roger has managed to hide in the cornfield. The cropduster continues to chase him and crash-landed headfirst into a moving truck and it explodes just like a bomb which is supposed to explode at any moment.</p>
    <h3 class="m-1">Red Herring:</h3>
    <p class="m-2">  The scene opens with Roger reaching the hotel which was supposed to be the one that Mr Kaplon is staying but to his surprise, he finds Ms Kendellthere. And they started to have conversations with both having separate Mid-shot and when Mr Roger sees the newspaper about the plane crash both the frames are combined into a one with Mr Roger shot in a much taller and superior in a threatening manner as he tries to find out what her connection with Vandmamm. And they are suddenly interrupted by a telephone call now the camera starts to move along with Ms Kendell and track down to show her purse which is containing a pistol.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="m-2">Now, look at the other image in which she shot him with the same pistol as we as an audience know that it was a trick to manipulate Vandmamm so that Roger and Kendell can get together.</p>

    <p class="m-2">  The next time we see the gun being when Leonard and Vandmannhas a discussion about the killing of Mr Roger and trustworthy nature of Ms Kendell. The scene begins with Leonard is hiding a gun behind him and starts the conversation about the faithfulness of Ms Kendell with 2 characters and 2 objects in the frame. The sculpture holds importance because it contains the microfilm involving the secrets of the government. As the scene progresses, Vandmamm continues to deny and accept the things about the loyalty of Kendell so Leonard pulls the gun from his back and shoots him, but only fires the blank and  Now, Vandmamm understood that this was a trick all along. Next time we see this gun Ms Townsend pointing the gun at Mr Roger. And this whole time Hitchcock manipulates us by looking at the fake gun, but in actuality fires a real gun to kill Leonard. In the process of creating a red herring for the story, Hitchcock made his protagonist's character as a massive red herring in the end. </p>
